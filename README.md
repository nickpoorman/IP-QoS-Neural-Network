IP QoS Neural Network
---------------------

This is a project for my Neural Nets class. Fall 11'


Problem
-------

Lookup times for an IP address to routing queue is slow. Due to this, sorting packets into queues can be a slow process.


Mission
-------

To produce a neural network that is able to sort packets by IP address.

Future Work
-----------

To produce a neural network that is also able to sort packets by port number.
