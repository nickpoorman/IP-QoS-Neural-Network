IP QoS Neural Network
---------------------

This is a project for my Neural Nets class. Fall 11'


Problem
-------

Lookup times for an IP address to routing queue is slow. Due to this, sorting packets into queues can be a slow process.


Mission
-------

To produce a neural network that is able return a packet queue for the packets to be placed in.

Future Work
-----------

To produce a neural network that is also able to sort packets by port number.
To make this network faster. Currently using BigDecial (slow).
There should be a wrapper for this project that imputs IP addresses, translates them to 32 / 64 bits (IPv4 / IPv6), and manages the queues w/ this implementation.
