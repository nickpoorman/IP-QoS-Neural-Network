IP QoS Neural Network
---------------------

This is a project for my Neural Nets class. Fall 11'


Problem
-------

Internet QoS fails to achieve fairness between specific hosts.


Mission
-------

To produce a working QoS that will dequeue packets based on weights produced by a neural network. The neural network will be the fairness regulator to an IP packet QoS implementation based on hosts.
